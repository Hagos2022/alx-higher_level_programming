# 0x02 Python - import & modules :snake:

> Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It's often used as a “scripting language” for web applications. This means that it can automate specific series of tasks, making it more efficient. This project covers topics of importing modules using python.

6. Program that imports all functions from the file calculator_1.py and handles basic operations.

7. Program that prints #pythoniscool, followed by a new line, in the standard output.
