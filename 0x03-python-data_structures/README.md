# 0x03 Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples :snake:

> Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It's often used as a “scripting language” for web applications. This means that it can automate specific series of tasks, making it more efficient. This project covers data structures in Python (list and tuples)

0. Function that prints all integers of a list.

1. Function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.

2. Function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).

3. Function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.

4. Function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).

5. Function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).

6. Function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).

7. Function that adds 2 tuples.

8. Function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.

9. Function that finds the biggest integer of a list.

10. Function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.

11. Function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.

12. Complete the source code in order to switch value of a and b

13. Function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome

14. C function that prints some basic info about Python lists
