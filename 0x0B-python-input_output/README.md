# 0x0B Python - Input/Output :snake:

This project has used the builtin with, open, and read functions with the json module to read and write files and serialize and deserialize objects with JSON.

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Function that reads a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout

1. Function that returns the number of lines of a text file

2. Function that reads n lines of a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout

3. Function that writes a string to a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters written

4. Function that appends a string at the end of a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters added

5. Function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string)

6. Function that returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string

7. Function that writes an Object to a text file, using a JSON representation

8. Function that creates an Object from a “JSON file”

9. Script that adds all arguments to a Python list, and then save them to a file

10. Function that returns the dictionary description with simple data structure (list, dictionary, string, integer and boolean) for JSON serialization of an object

11. Class Student that defines a student

12. Class Student that defines a student by: (based on 11-student.py)

13. Class Student that defines a student by: (based on 12-student.py)

14. Function def pascal_triangle(n): that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal’s triangle of n

15. Function that inserts a line of text to a file, after each line containing a specific string

16. Script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics (Task in progress)

17. Script that finds a string in the heap of a running process, and replaces it
